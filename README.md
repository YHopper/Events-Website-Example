Events Website Assignment
---------------------------------
Hello! This is my first attempt at creating an events website via HTML and CSS. I used an existing venue from where I live as the base, and created the website with the current knowledge I've gained from Coding Temple. 

By default the website should start at "Home" or index.html. Every option on the navigation bar and the button on the banner are clickable, and they will direct the user to the relevant page.
Naturally, clicking "The Vines Center" will take the user back to the home page.

Home -> displays the banner, testimonials, the map of the venue, and a contact form

About -> displays the history, mission, usage options for the venue, the team, and a contact form

Events -> displays upcoming events, a table of prices, a list of and a contact form
